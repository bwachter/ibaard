* ibaard

This is a library with various helper functions useful in small C-programs. It works well with statically linked binaries and for embedded devices. The library itself is only built as static library. Preferred use is to compile it within a project, either as git submodule, or by downloading a tarball.

Projects using ibaard include:

- [[http://bwachter.lart.info/projects/aardmail/][aardmail]], a simple pop3 and smtp client
- [[http://bwachter.lart.info/projects/asvm/][asvm]], a tiny service monitor

API documentation can be built using doxygen, and is published to [[https://bwachter.github.io/ibaard/html/][github pages]].
